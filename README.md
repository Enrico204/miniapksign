# Mini APK Sign

A Go library for parsing, checking or generating APK signatures.

This is the roadmap: checked boxes are implemented features, while the rest is the roadmap.

* V1 signature
  * [X] extraction and parsing
  * [X] verification and generation
  * [ ] automatic tests
* V2 signature
  * [X] extraction and parsing
  * [ ] verification and generation
  * [ ] automatic tests
* V3 signature
  * [ ] extraction and parsing
  * [ ] verification and generation
  * [ ] automatic tests
* V4 signature
  * [ ] extraction and parsing
  * [ ] verification and generation
  * [ ] automatic tests

The library follows the semantic versioning.
Until v1, breaking changes can occur in any moment, and the code might be incomplete.

## Usage

Use `go get` for this library:

```sh
go get gitlab.com/enrico204/miniapksign@latest
```

The `cmd/` directory contains some examples.
